Your tooth has a tube running from top to bottom. This needs to be cleaned, widened and then filled. Root fillings fill the tube from the part of the tooth you can see to the end of your root underneath your gum.Extraction is the complete removal of a tooth from your mouth.",

            "Implants are a safe, well-established treatment. It’s probably true to say that implants, much like natural teeth, will last for as long as you care for them.How well you look after your implants – and whether you go for your regular maintenance appointments – will have the biggest impact on how long they will last.If you don’t look after your implants they will develop a coating similar to what you get on neglected natural teeth. Left untreated, this can lead to gum infection, bleeding, soreness and general discomfort. You could get all these problems with natural teeth.",

            "Dental crowns are used to repair teeth that have been badly damaged by decay or injury. As a dental restoration, crowns are pretty much the only things that save damaged teeth from extraction. They are also used to correct cosmetic imperfections. Usually, it takes two dentist appointments to complete the procedure, because most crowns have to be made in a dental laboratory. Some general dentists are able to make the crowns themselves, however, and that makes it possible for a patient to get a dental crown placed in a single day.",

The placement of dental implants involves minor oral surgery to place the implant into the patient’s jawbone.Though the process takes a few months and several procedures to complete, the placement of dental implants gives the patient permanent artificial teeth. Implant-supported crowns and dentures work just like real teeth.",
